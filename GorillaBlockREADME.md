GorillaBlock is a mod where you can block people in game! 
With the mod, block buttons are put on the leaderboards. When you block someone with the button, it grabs their player ID and puts it in a list of blocked IDs. 
When you are in a room, it scans for the blocked IDs, and if one is found, it will mute that person and highlight their name as red.
Blocked IDs can be removed through GorillaBlock.cfg in the "config" file in BepInEx.
